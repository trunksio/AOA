## Timeline

| Stage | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Stage 1 | 1 week | None |
| Stage 2 | 1 week | Stage 1 |
| Stage 3 | 2 weeks | Stage 2 |
| Stage 4 | 2 weeks | Stage 3 |
| Stage 5 | 1 week | Stage 4 |
| Stage 6 | 2 weeks | Stage 5 |
| Stage 7 | 1 week | Stage 6 |

**Total Duration**: 10 weeks

## Success Criteria

Each stage must meet the following criteria before proceeding:
1. All unit tests passing (>90% coverage)
2. Documentation complete and reviewed
3. Integration tests with previous stages passing
4. Performance benchmarks met
5. Code review completed

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| LLM API rate limits | Implement caching and fallback strategies |
| Graph database performance | Use query optimization and indexing |
| Agent communication latency | Implement async processing and caching |
| Complex chain failures | Build robust error handling and recovery |
