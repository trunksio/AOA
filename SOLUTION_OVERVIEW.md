# Agent Oriented Architecture (AOA) Reference Implementation

## Executive Summary

This repository provides a reference implementation of Agent Oriented Architecture (AOA), demonstrating a distributed system of specialized AI agents that collaborate to fulfill complex tasks. The architecture leverages the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for discovery, Kuzu graph database for agent registry, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Agent Oriented Architecture (AOA)

AOA is a software architecture pattern where:
- **Agents** are autonomous, specialized components with narrow, well-defined capabilities
- **Discovery** enables dynamic agent location and capability matching
- **Composition** allows agents to chain together to solve complex tasks
- **Decoupling** ensures agents can evolve independently while maintaining interoperability

### Key Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each agent focuses on a specific capability
2. **Scalability**: New agents can be added without modifying existing ones
3. **Flexibility**: Agents can be composed in different ways for different tasks
4. **Maintainability**: Individual agents can be updated independently
5. **Reusability**: Agents can be reused across different workflows

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

1. **Discovery Layer**
   - `.well-known/aoa-registry` endpoint for standardized discovery
   - Discovery Agent for intent analysis and routing

2. **Registry Layer**
   - Kuzu Graph Database for storing agent relationships and capabilities
   - Registry API for querying agent information

3. **Agent Network**
   - Specialized agents with MCP tools
   - LLM-driven decision making
   - Clear capability boundaries

### A2A Protocol

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol defines:
- Standardized discovery mechanisms
- Capability declaration format
- Communication patterns between agents
- Intent-based routing

## Implementation Technologies

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Graph Database**: Kuzu (embedded graph database)
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol for agent capabilities
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI for HTTP endpoints
- **Container**: Docker for deployment

## Agent Types

### 1. Discovery Agent
- Analyzes incoming intents
- Queries the registry for capable agents
- Orchestrates agent chains
- Returns results to clients

### 2. Data Store Agents
- CRUD operations on various data stores
- SQL, NoSQL, Vector databases
- File system operations
- API integrations

### 3. Analytics Agents
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning inference
- Data aggregation
- Pattern recognition

### 4. Visualization Agents
- Chart generation
- Dashboard creation
- Report formatting
- Data presentation

### 5. Transform Agents
- Data format conversion
- Schema mapping
- Data validation
- ETL operations

### 6. Integration Agents
- External API calls
- Webhook handling
- Event processing
- Protocol translation

## Intent-Based Routing

The system uses natural language intents to determine which agents to invoke:

```
Client: "Analyze sales data from last quarter and create a visualization"
         ↓
Discovery Agent: Identifies need for:
  1. Data Store Agent (retrieve sales data)
  2. Analytics Agent (analyze trends)
  3. Visualization Agent (create charts)
         ↓
Result: Agent chain execution and response
```
